# Installation
Fabric is best installed via pip (highly recommended) or easy_install (older, but still works fine), 
eg:

```sh
$ pip install fabric
```
You may also opt to use your operating systems package manager; the package is typically called fabric or python-fabric

eg:

```sh
$ sudo apt-get install fabric
```

Advanced users wanting to install a development version may use pip to grab the lastest master branch (as vell as the dev version of paramiko)
```sh
$ pip install paramiko==dev
$ pip install fabric==dev
```
